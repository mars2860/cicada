Coreless Motor 816

The motors in the Syma X5HW drone are coreless motors with directional metal brushes. You can run them in reverse by reversing the polarity, but they run better forward. The life of metal brush inside the coreless motor can be severely limited if operated in reverse direction for extended period of times.
